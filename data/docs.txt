I live in an apartment, and I don’t see my neighbors very often,  
so I don’t even know all of their names.  
There’s an older couple living near me, and they’re always very kind.

One time, I had to travel for a few days,  
and I was worried about my cat being home alone.  
I asked my neighbors if they could help feed my cat,  
and they were very friendly and happy to help.  
They’re really approachable and warm people,  
and that’s what my neighborhood is like.

There’s also an elderly couple living next door,  
but I don’t see them very often either.  
We don’t run into each other frequently,  
and I’ve only seen them a couple of times  
when I come home from work.  
They’re very kind as well.

Another time, I had to be away for a few days,  
and again I was worried about my cat.  
I asked them to do me a favor and feed him,  
and they were happy to help.  
Overall, my neighbors are friendly and helpful.
